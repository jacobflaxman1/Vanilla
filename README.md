# Audio Visualizer

## Technologies
This utilizes only vanilla javascript API's.

All of the visualization is done using a canvas element. The audio is taken from the analyser node from the webaudioapi and send to the canvas portion being drawn.




Thanks to @hakimel for the inspiration on creating the visualizer. :)
